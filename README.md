# About

This set of scrpits helps figure out network information and stores it on a file in the home directory. This is helpful if you need to store the output of the network at one particular point in time. nmcli is specific to Fedora (and probably RHEL) while test.sh can be used with any computer as long as the lshw modual is installed on the machine. Hope that you enjoy!
